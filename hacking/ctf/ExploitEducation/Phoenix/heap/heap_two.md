1) first thing we allocate our auth string on the heap using:  
```
auth AAAA
```
2) now we use the   
```
reset
```
for freeing the memory allocated on the heap.  

3) next we call 
```
service
```
and we bring it a service that is 32 bytes long.
(because we freed the auth var, when we call <b>service</b> we allocate memory on the heap, where the auth variable was.  

4)  then when we overflow it we make the auth of auth (auth -> auth) to have the value 0xa (new line)

5)  now because the auth value is not 0, when we use the 
```
login
```  
command it worked :)
